This tool eliminates the need to switch between multiple cloud interfaces. By turning your remote storage into accessible Finder volumes, Mountain Duck makes your workflow simpler and faster. You can open any remote document with local applications, and all edits are automatically synchronized back to the source — ensuring your files stay up to date everywhere.

It supports **two-factor authentication, TLS/SSL encryption, and file versioning**, keeping your data safe during transfer and storage.
